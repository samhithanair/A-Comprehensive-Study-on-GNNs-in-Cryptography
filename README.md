# Ciphertext Prediction Using GNNs

## Overview

This project implements a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to predict ciphertexts generated by classical ciphers, including Caesar, Rail Fence, Playfair, and Vigenère ciphers. The primary goal is to explore how GNNs can model and predict ciphertext outputs based on input plaintext and cipher configurations.

---

## Support for Multiple Ciphers
   - **Caesar Cipher**: Predicts ciphertext based on a shift value.
   - **Rail Fence Cipher**: Predicts ciphertext using a specific number of rails for encryption.
   - **Playfair Cipher**: Predicts ciphertext based on a key matrix.
   - **Vigenère Cipher**: Predicts ciphertext using a keyword-based encryption technique.
